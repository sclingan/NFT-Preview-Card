## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

Using React to learn more and push myself. I need to work more on SASS and use the cascade better. I learned more
about naming conventions and also using SVG's. Layering images for hover effects was a challenge, I need more practive.


### Continued development

I will continue working on accessibility and layering images on hover effects. Also need to work more
with SVG's.
